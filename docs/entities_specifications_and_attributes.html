<div class="textblock"><p>The concepts discussed on this page are key to understanding how OAIO extends beyond the simple resolution of an <a class="el" href="glossary.html#entity_reference">Entity Reference</a> into a file path into first-class asset centric workflows.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Entities"></a>
Entities</h1>
<p>To recap, within OAIO, a <a class="el" href="glossary.html#host">host</a> communicates with an <a class="el" href="glossary.html#asset_management_system">Asset Management System</a> to query and manage the existence of <a class="el" href="glossary.html#entity">entities</a>. An entity is a logical thing managed within a pipeline or workflow by the asset manager. Within the Media and Entertainment sector, this could be a shot, an image sequence, a 3D model or a script.</p>
<p>At its core OAIO has no detailed understanding of the specifics of any given entity, only that conceptually they may or may not exist, and may or may not have multiple versions or relationships to other entities.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Specifications"></a>
Specifications</h1>
<p>When a host interacts with an asset management system, the <a class="el" href="glossary.html#entity_reference">Entity Reference</a> is used to identify a specific <a class="el" href="glossary.html#entity">entity</a> within the system. These references are (generally) in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URI</a>. The format of the reference itself is owned by the <a class="el" href="glossary.html#manager">manager</a> and is conceptually opaque to the host. Because of this (and the fact that it is specifically only an identifier), no concrete information about an entity can be determined from its reference alone.</p>
<p>If a host needs to be able to load data addressed via an entity reference, it may need to know what kind of entity it is. When publishing data to an asset management system, it needs to be able to inform the manager what kind of data is being registered.</p>
<p>Within OAIO, type identification is accomplished by the <a class="el" href="classopenassetio_1_1_specification_1_1_specification.html">Specification</a> mechanism. Specifications are a hierarchical type system that can carry arbitrary additional data to refine its description. An example of this being an ImageSequenceSpecification, that additionally describes a colorspace or frame range.</p>
<p>Specifications are used within OAIO in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To define the type of an entity:<ul>
<li>When a host needs correctly loaded referenced data.</li>
<li>When new data is registered with a manager.</li>
<li>To filter browsers and other UI delegated to a manager.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To define the nature of a relationship when working with related entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Specification consists of a schema identifier string along with an optional set of key/value pairs. The schema identifier determines the absolute type of an entity, and what keys may be used for additional description.</p>
<dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>The specification only serves as a type <em>identifier</em> and is mapped to a manager's internal classification mechanisms. Additional data from the specification's key/value pairs is not persisted beyond the lifetime of the related API calls in any literal form. If a host wishes to persist any other information about an entity, use the <a class="el" href="glossary.html#attributes">Attributes</a> mechanism instead.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section see"><dt>See also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="classopenassetio_1_1_specification_1_1_specification.html">Specification</a></dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="specification_hierarchy"></a>
The Specification Hierarchy</h2>
<p>The specification's schema identifier uses a prefix + type pair, for example <code>entity:file.image</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>prefix</b> defines its broad categorization into one of several discrete classifications. eg: <code>entity</code>, <code>relationship</code>, etc.</li>
<li>The <b>type</b> is a simple dot-delimited hierarchy of types within the specification's classification. eg: <code>file.image</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hierarchical nature of the specification type system allows for a host or manager's behavior to be determined at a base level, and applied to any derived specification schemas automatically.</p>
<p>For example, a manager may customize the publishing of all <code>entity:file.document</code> specifications to store them in a different location and adjust the versioning strategy. A new host may choose to represent its documents via a <code>entity:file.document.nodegraph.someapp</code> schema identifier. The manager handling publishing can temporarily upcast to the document base to determine its behavior, treating it similarly to other documents, or choose to add specific functionality if desired.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a manager customizes its internal behavior for any given specification (beyond the baseline required by the API), the preservation of an entity's full schema identifier is essential. A manager is required to always consider the full string when implementing <a class="el" href="namespaceopenassetio_1_1manager_a_p_i_1_1_manager_interface.html">ManagerInterface</a> methods that use a Specification as part of their parameters.</p>
<p>To continue the example above, a browser requested for the <code>entity:file.document.nodegraph.someapp</code> specification, should not list any other entities derived from <code>entity:file.document</code>. The same would be true for a query for related references using the application specific specification - even if some aspect of the manager's internal behavior switches on <code>entity:file.document</code>, only references for the node graphs produced by someapp should be returned.</p>
<p>Conversely, when querying a base type, all derived entities should be returned.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="specification_mapping"></a>
Mapping to Native Types</h2>
<p>Where possible, both hosts and managers should attempt to map well-known specifications to their native types. A manager with no UI of its own may not need to, but in most situations, a consistent mapping of specifications to first-class concepts is essential for a well-formed user experience.</p>
<p>For example, a compositor may map an ImageSequenceSpecification to its native image read and write nodes, and a manager map the same to its own supported clip format so transcodes are generated and displayed in its browser.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="specification_selection"></a>
Picking a Specification to Use</h2>
<p>As a <a class="el" href="glossary.html#host">host</a>, it is important to use the correct specification when making calls to a <a class="el" href="glossary.html#manager">manager</a>. This ensures the expected type of entity is returned or registered. A manager must also accurately describe any entities when requested. In order to facilitate a common dialog between OAIO compatible systems, the project provides a set of well-known specifications. Always use one of these where possible as they are, by definition, also known to other tools in the OAIO ecosystem.</p>
<p>Hosts and managers are also free to make their own specifications for native types. For example, deriving from the DocumentSpecification to represent a DCC tool's native file format. They should however, always use the most specific well-known specification as a base. This ensures maximum compatibility with other tools. Any new tool, manager or vendor specific schemas should be listed in the appropriate technical documentation supplied with the software.</p>
<dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>The library of well-known OAIO base schemas is yet to be ported from <code>FnAssetAPI</code>, and will be available soon.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Attributes"></a>
Attributes</h1>
<p>Entities are generally more than just a file on disk, they have additional data that defines their properties or interpretation.</p>
<p>In its simplest form, OpenAssetIO's <a class="el" href="glossary.html#attributes">Attributes</a> system can be used by a <a class="el" href="glossary.html#host">host</a> to store and retrieve additional data about an entity from an <a class="el" href="glossary.html#asset_management_system">Asset Management System</a> without the need for side-car files.</p>
<p>An example of this is within a tool that displays image sequences. The <a class="el" href="glossary.html#primary_string">Primary String</a> is resolved to provide the path to the images on disk, and the attributes provided by the manager used to control the colorspace and frame range used for playback. This can avoid fragile mechanisms such as extension-based mappings and directory searches.</p>
<p>Extending this further, an entity's primary string does not have to be a file path, or even a URL.</p>
<p>If it's possible to break down the description of an entity into a string, and/or set of named values, OAIO can be used directly to publish or query entities of this type.</p>
<p>A common application of this is its use in a timeline based application to query and publish shot timing information directly to a production tracking system.</p>
<p>The API contract states that a <a class="el" href="glossary.html#manager">manager</a> <b>must</b> guarantee to store and recall any value registered by this mechanism for supported specifications. This allows a host to manage arbitrary data through the asset management system without any special handling by the manager itself.</p>
<p>If a Manager holds entities created by means other than OAIO (its own interface, other APIs, etc...) then it is important that it 'bridges' any attributes from the well-known OAIO names to its corresponding internal name, for both set and get.</p>
<dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>In OAIO, attributes are limited to simple constants using basic types such as string, float, int and bool. Time-varying data is beyond the scope of this API and should be managed through alternate means such as <a href="http://opentimeline.io" target="_blank">OpenTimelineIO</a> or similar. </dd></dl>
