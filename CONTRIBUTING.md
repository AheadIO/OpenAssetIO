# Contributing

This project operates a Pull Request model, using the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
approach. The rough outline is as follows:

1. Chat with the Trusted Committers and community to define the scope of
   work
2. Fork the repo, and work in a branch
3. Create a Pull Request for Code Review
4. Address any comments
5. Work is merged

The main aim of the process is to keep people in the loop - avoiding any
surprises later on. This helps avoid churn/frustration for all involved.

More details on the development process will be provided soon. In the
meantime, please open an Issue or contact one of the Trusted Committers.

## Coding standards

The mix of languages used in this project means there are some important
guidelines on how to format code and documentation written for the
project. These are outlined in the [coding
standards](contributing/CODING_STANDARDS.md) guide.
